# Pop Songs and Political Science
## Morning Train

### Sheena Easton and Game Theory

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

1. Takes the morning train
2. Works from nine 'til five
3. Takes another train home again
4. Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict) game**.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern)
- Solution: **mixed strategy**


## Never Gonna Give You Up

### Rick Astley's Re-election Platform

Rick Astley's campaign promises:

- Never gonna give you up.
- Never gonna let you down.
- Never gonna run around and desert you.
- Never gonna make you cry.
- Never gonna say goodbye.
- Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Whereas these pledges conform to the preferences of the **median voter**, we expect Congressman Astley to secure re-election.

## Caribbean Queen
### Caribbean Queen and Operation Urgent Fury

In 1984, Billy Ocean released ``Caribbean Queen''.

- Emphasized sharing the same dream
- Hearts beating as one

``Caribbean Queen'' is about the poor execution of Operation Urgent Fury.

- Echoed JCS chairman David Jones' frustrations with military establishment.

Billy Ocean is advancing calls for what became the Goldwater-Nichols Act.

- Wanted to take advantage of **economies of scale**, resolve **coordination problems** in U.S. military.

## Good Day
### The Good Day Hypothesis

We know the following about Ice Cube's day.

1. The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
2. No helicopter looked for a murder.
3. Consumed Fatburger at 2 a.m.
4. Goodyear blimp: "Ice Cube's a pimp."

This leads to two different hypotheses:

- $H_0$: Ice Cube's day is statistically indistinguishable from a typical day.
- $H_1$: Ice Cube is having a good (i.e. greater than average) day.

These hypotheses are tested using archival data of Ice Cube's life.
